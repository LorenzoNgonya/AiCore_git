# ** Hangman project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first project learning code, with the use of the following technologies: VS Code, Python, Git, Github and other minipackages such as PYtest.

## Milestone 1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Using python built in functions I have created a list containing 5 of my favourites fruits. By coding certain characters I am able to use different like the list[] function or the print() function as demonstrated below.

## Milestone 1.1
---
- In this milestone I used a theh Python built-in *import random* module which allows the user to return a rnadom item from a given sequence through the *choice* method. By using *random.choice* method and passig the *word_list* from milestone 1 as the *choice* variable it allows us to randomly generate a word from *word_list*. I assigned the generated word to the variable *word*

## Milestone 1.2
---
- In this milestone I used the *input* function to get the user to input a single letter in the from a string which I assigned the variable *guess*. To validate the input I used *if* statements to make a conditional that the input should be a single alphabetical letter. I the condition is met, I used the *print* function to  print "Good Guess!". if the conditional is not met I used the *else* block to print "Oops! That is not a valid input."

## Conclusion 
---
- From my understanding of the project so far is that most of the tools needed to write are there it is matter of learning and trying different approaches to problems.
