# ** Hangman project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
first project learning code, with the use of the following technologies: VS Code, Python, Git, Github and other minipackages such as PYtest.

## Milestone 1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Using python built in functions I have created a list containing 5 of my favourites fruits. By coding certain characters I am able to use different like the list[] function or the print() function as demonstrated below.

![]()



## Milestone 1.1
---
- In this milestone I used a theh Python built-in *import random* module which allows the user to return a rnadom item from a given sequence through the *choice* method. By using *random.choice* method and passig the *word_list* from milestone 1 as the *choice* variable it allows us to randomly generate a word from *word_list*. I assigned the generated word to the variable *word*

![]()


## Milestone 1.2
---
- In this milestone I used the *input* function to get the user to input a single letter in the from a string which I assigned the variable *guess*. To validate the input I used *if* statements to make a conditional that the input should be a single alphabetical letter. I the condition is met, I used the *print* function to  print "Good Guess!". if the conditional is not met I used the *else* block to print "Oops! That is not a valid input."

## Milestone 2.0
-----------------
- In this task I created a code that will continuously ask the user for a letter and validate it.
- By creating a while loop with the condition set to true allowed the code to run continuously. In the body of the while loop I  wrote the code for the following steps instructions:
    - Asking the user to guess a letter and assigning it to the guess variable.
    - Checking the guess is a single, alphabetical character.
    - Break out of the loop if the guess passes the checks.
    - By utilisng the use of else statement if the guess does not pass the checks, print a message saying "Invalid letter. Please, enter a single alphabetical character."

## Milestone 2.1

- In this task I had to check whether the letter guessed by the user is in the secret randomly chosen word generated by the computer. e.g. if the user guesses the letter "r" and the secret word is "serene", then the code checks if "r" is in "serene".
- To accomplish this I created an if statement to check if the guess is in the word. In the body of the if statement, I created code to print a message saying "Good guess! {guess} is in the word.". For {guess} I used the .format function to show the actual guess type by the user. I then created an else block that prints a message saying "Sorry, {guess} is not in the word. Try again." if the guess is not in the word.

## Milestone 2.2

### In this part of the task I had to create 2 functions: check_guess and ask_for_input functions. 
- The check_guess function will take the guessed letter as an argument and check if the letter is in the word.
    - I defined a function called check_guess. Then passed in the guess as a parameter for the function.
    - In the body of this function I wrote a code to convert the guess into lower case.
    - I then moved the code I wrote to check if the guesss is in the word into this function block.

- The ask_for_input function will ask the user for inpout.
    - I defined a function called ask_for_input.
    - I then moved the code to Iteratively check if the input is a valid guess task 
    - I called the check_guess function to check if the guess is in the word into this function block, but outside the while loop and passed in the guess as an argument to the method.
    - I then called the ask_for_input function to test your code outside the function.

## Conclusion 
---
- From my understanding of the project so far is that most of the tools needed to write code are there it is matter of learning and trying different approaches to problems. As the project progresses I'm understanding how the small pieces of code (statements and while loops) are used to create other bigger codes (functions).
